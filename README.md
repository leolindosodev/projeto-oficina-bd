# Service Order Control System for a Mechanical Workshop

 ### ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Title:

Creating a conceptual scheme for the context of a mechanic's workshop.

### ðŸ’­ Challenge Origin:

Challenge proposed by Professor **__Juliana Mascarenhas__** for the project challenge "Building a conceptual scheme for a database" on the **__DIO__** platform.

### ðŸ’­ Narrative:

Service order execution control and management system in a mechanic's workshop
Customers take vehicles to the mechanic's workshop to be repaired or to undergo periodic inspections
Each vehicle is assigned to a team of mechanics who identify the services to be performed and fill out a service order with a delivery date.
The service order is used to calculate the value of each service.
The customer authorizes or denies the execution of the services.
The mechanic validates and performs the services.
Mechanics have a code, name, address and specialty.
Each service order has: number, date of issue, a value, status and a date for completion of the work.

### âœ… What is contained in the schema:

:black_square_button: Entities

:key: Primary Keys

:white_circle: Simple Attributes

:large_blue_diamond: Relationships

( :one: , :one: ) Cardinality

### âœ… Concepts used:

In this small project, Inheritance concepts were used, which we can observe when viewing the "*Person*" entity that has generic attributes, thus avoiding information redundancy. Specialization concept, when dividing the "*Mechanic*" entity from the "*Customer*" entity, each with its own specific attributes.
Each entity has its own identifier, thus allowing a flexible model.
